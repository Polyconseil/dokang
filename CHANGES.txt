==========

Dokang 0.4.0 (2014-07-04)
-------------------------

- A new ``dokang.hit_limit`` option has been added to the INI
  configuration file. It limits the number of results shown on the web
  front-end (or lift this limit if the option is absent).


Dokang 0.3.0 (2014-07-04)
-------------------------

- Fixed bug in the HTML harvester. Trying to use it would fail with an
  exception because Whoosh would complain about something that
  unexpectedly is a byte string.

- Fixed bug in the handling of deleted documents. They were not
  deleted from the index.


Dokang 0.2.0 (2014-06-24)
-------------------------

Initial version.
