Change log
==========

Dokang 0.6.0 (2015-03-03)
-------------------------

- Drop Python 2.6 support.

- Make documentation available from the root of Dokang ("/"). This
  change is backward-incompatible.

  Before this commit, if the upload dir was named "uploaded", the
  documentation would be available at ``/uploaded/<doc_set_id>``. This
  was a bit too verbose.
    
  With this (backward-incompatible) change, the documentation is now
  available at ``/<doc_set_id>``.


Dokang 0.5.0 (2015-02-18)
-------------------------

- Add "highlight" in the query string of the URLs of search results.
  This parameter is understood by Sphinx-generated HTML files.

- Add documentation uploading end point (to use Dokang web frontend to serve the documentation)


Dokang 0.4.2 (2014-09-01)
-------------------------

- Fix bad-looking (but working) URLs generated in the web front-end.
  They used to contain two consecutive slashes (for example
  http://example.com/project//doc.html) when the configuration of the
  project had a slash at the end of its URL.


Dokang 0.4.1 (2014-08-27)
-------------------------

- Fixed MANIFEST.in so that the Python package contains all templates
  and stylesheets required by the web front-end.


Dokang 0.4.0 (2014-07-04)
-------------------------

- A new ``dokang.hit_limit`` option has been added to the INI
  configuration file. It limits the number of results shown on the web
  front-end (or lifts this limit if the option is absent).


Dokang 0.3.0 (2014-07-04)
-------------------------

- Fix bug in the HTML harvester. Trying to use it would fail with an
  exception because Whoosh would complain about something that
  unexpectedly is a byte string.

- Fix bug in the handling of deleted documents. They were not deleted
  from the index.


Dokang 0.2.0 (2014-06-24)
-------------------------

Initial version.
