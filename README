Dokang is a lightweight search engine for HTML documents with a web
frontend.

Status: Dokang is fully functional and works for us but has a few
limitations:

- it only indexes Sphinx documents that use the "Read The Docs"
  theme. Currently, we look for a particular "<div>" element to
  extract the content from HTML files. This limitation may be lifted
  by adding another key in the configuration dictionary that instructs
  Dokang how to look for content in a given document (the name of the
  harvester plugin to call, for example);

- the indexing and search features are minimal. They work but could
  certainly be tweaked to be faster, provide better results or, who
  knows, both;

- Dokang does not detect deleted documents. You may work around that by
  removing the document set (with the "clean" command) and indexing it
  again (with the "index" command);

- the two-file configuration is a bit unfortunate. The INI file is
  useful for WSGI servers but defining structured options is much
  easier in Python.
