Dokang is a lightweight search engine with a web frontend.

Status: Dokang is fully functional and works for us but has a few
limitations:

- the indexing and search features are minimal. They work but could
  certainly be tweaked to be faster, provide better results or, who
  knows, both;

- the two-file configuration is a bit unfortunate. The INI file is
  useful for WSGI servers but defining structured options is much
  easier in Python;

- more generally, the configuration may be a bit discouraging.
  Suggestions and contributions are welcome.
