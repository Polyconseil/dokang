Dokang
======

Dokang is a lightweight search engine for HTML documents. It comes
with a command line program and a web frontend. It is lightweight in
the sense that it is merely a wrapper around the Whoosh search engine
with a very simple HTML text indexer.

We (Polyconseil) use it to search through the `Sphinx
<http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_-generated documentation of all our
projects.
